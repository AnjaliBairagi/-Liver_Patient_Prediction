# -Liver_Patient_Prediction
Developed a Liver Disease Prediction Model with ILPD dataset using preprocessing, scaling, and EDA.  Achieved up to ~85% accuracy by evaluating multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).  Enhanced model performance with hyperparameter tuning for efficiency and reliability.
